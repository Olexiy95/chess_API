# Chess Analyser

Scripts for leveraging chess.com API endpoints with python chess library. 

Potential uses are data analysis and visualisation of stats, machine learning applications and engine related development.

Per documentation, chess.com API currently only supports GET type requests.

Plans are to release a more interactive API in the future to allow sending (POST) of moves and other commands.
